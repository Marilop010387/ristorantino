# Ristorantino MÃ¡gico CakePHP Project 

### How to install?
.... into your webroot folder run

```
composer create-project -s dev ristorantino/ristorantino
```

Do not delete VCS files (.git files) if you are a developer
when asking:
Do you want to remove the existing VCS (.git, .svn..) history? [Y,n]? 
PRESS NOOOOO!!!


Then you need to:

1) check perms in filesystem
2) go to your web browser, visit http://localhost/ristorantino 
3) Run web installer


## Requirements
You need composer (https://getcomposer.org) and Git installed, so dependencies are auto-managed.
